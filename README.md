Introduction
# The purpose of this project is to classify different classes of mice based on their features. This classification helps in understanding and analyzing the characteristics of various mice classes for research and study purposes.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes various features of mice. Key columns in the dataset include:

Feature 1: Description of feature 1
Feature 2: Description of feature 2
Feature 3: Description of feature 3
(Add more features as applicable)
Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Preprocess the data for classification
# Train a machine learning model to classify mice
# Evaluate the performance of the model
Methodology
The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
# Model Training: Using various classification algorithms to train the model.
# Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results
The classification model achieved an accuracy of X% (replace with actual accuracy).
# Other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are reported.
